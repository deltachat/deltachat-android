# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for looking for ways to help on Delta Chat Android!

This document tries to outline some conventions that may not be obvious
and aims to give a good starting point to new contributors.


## Reporting Bugs

If you found a bug, [report it on Github](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues).

Project maintainers may transfer bugs that are not UI specific
(eg. network, database or encryption related)
to [Delta Chat Core](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/issues).
If you assume beforehand, that the bug you've found belongs to Core,
you can report there directly.

Please search both open and closed issues to make sure your bug report is not a duplicate.

For community interactions around Delta Chat
please read our [Community Standards](https://delta.chat/community-standards).


## Proposing Features

If you have a feature request,
create a new topic on the [Forum](https://support.delta.chat/c/features/6).


## Rough UX Philosophy

Some rough ideas, that may be helpful when thinking about how to enhance things:

- Work hard to avoid options and up-front choices.
  Thinking about concrete user stories may help on that
- Avoid to speak about keys and other hard to understand things in the primary UI
- The app shall work offline as well as with bad network
- Users do not read (much)
- Consistency matters
- Offer only things that are highly useful to many people in primary UI.
  If really needed, bury other things eg. in some menus
- The app should be for the many, not for the few


## Contributing Code

The [README](./README.md) explains in detail how to set up the build environment.
Please follow all steps precisely.
If you run into troubles,
ask on of the [cummunication channels](https://delta.chat/contribute) for help.

To contribute code,
[open a Pull Request](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/pulls).

If you have write access to the repository,
push a branch named `<username>/<feature>`
so it is clear who is responsible for the branch,
and open a PR proposing to merge the change.
Otherwise fork the repository and create a branch in your fork.

Please add a meaningful description to your PR
so that reviewers get an idea about what the modifications are supposed to do.

A meaningful PR title is helpful for [updating `CHANGELOG.md` on releases](./RELEASE.md)
(CHANGELOG.md is updated manually
to only add things that are at least roughly understandable by the end user)

If the changes affect the user interface,
screenshots are very helpful,
esp. before/after screenshots.


### Coding Conventions

Source files are partly derived from different other open source projects
and may follow different coding styles and conventions.

If you do a PR fixing a bug or adding a feature,
please embrace the coding convention you see in the corresponding files,
so that the result fits well together.

Do not refactor or rename things in the same PR
to make the diff small and the PR easy to review.

Project language is Java.

By using [Delta Chat Core](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust)
there is already a strong separation between "UI" and "Model".
Further separations and abstraction layers are often not helpful
and only add more complexity.

Try to avoid premature optimisation
and complexity because it "may be needed in some future".
Usually, it is not.

Readable code is better than having some Java paradigms fulfilled.
Classic Java has a strong drive to add lots of classes, factories, one-liner-functions.
Try to not follow these patterns and keep things really on point and simple.
If this gets in conflict with embracing existing style, however,
consistency with existing code is more important.

The "Delta Chat Core" is a high-level interface to what the UI actually needs,
data should be served in a form that the UI do not need much additional work.
If this is not the case, consider a feature proposal to "Delta Chat Core".


### Merging Conventions

PR are merged usually to the branch `main` from which [releases](./RELEASE.md) are done.

As a default, do a `git rebase main` in case feature branches and `main` differ too much.

Once a PR has an approval, unless stated otherwise, it can be merged by the author.
A PR may be approved but postponed to be merged eg. because of an ongoing release.

To ensure the correct merge merge strategy, merging left up to the PR author:

- Usually, PR are squash-merged
  as UI development often results in tiny tweak commits that are not that meaningful on their own.
- If all commits are meaningful and have a well-written description,
  they can be rebased-merged.

If you do not have write access to the repository,
you may leave a note in the PR about the desired merge strategy.


## Translations

Translations are done via [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/delta-chat/),
you can log in there with your E-Mail Address or with a Github or Google handle.
You find two projects there:
- "Delta Chat App" contains the strings used in the app's UI
- "Delta Chat Website" contains the offline help from "Settings / Help"
  as well as the pages used on <https://delta.chat>

Most strings and the whole help are used for all systems
(Android, iOS, Linux, Windows, macOS)
and should be formulated accordingly.

If you want to change the english sources,
do a PR to [`strings.xml`](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/blob/main/res/values/strings.xml)
or to [`help.md`](https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-pages/blob/master/en/help.md).
Again, please do not mix adding things and refactorings, esp. for `help.md`,
this would require retranslations and should be considered carefully.
