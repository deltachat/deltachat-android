      </h2>

<p>Delta Chat is a new chat app that sends messages via e-mails, encrypted if possible, with Autocrypt. 
<strong>You do not have to sign up anywhere, just use your existing e-mail account with Delta Chat.</strong></p>

      </h3>

<p>With Delta Chat, you can write to every existing e-mail address - even
if the recipient is not using the Delta Chat app. No need for the
recipient to install the same app as yours, as with other messengers.</p>

  <li><em>Largest userbase</em> - recipients <em>not</em> using Delta Chat can be reached as well.</li>

      </h3>

<p>By default, Delta Chat shows all e-mails.</p>

<p>At “Settings -&gt; Chats &amp;
Media -&gt; Show Classic E-Mails”, you can change this. You have these options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“No, chats only”: Only messages sent by other Delta Chat users and replies to
your Delta Chat messages are shown. This makes most sense if you use the same
e-mail account for normal e-mails as well.</li>
  <li>“All”: Delta Chat shows all e-mails that are sent to your email address. This
makes sense if you want to use Delta Chat for all your e-mails, so no message
gets lost. This is the default setting.</li>
  <li>“For accepted contacts”: Delta Chat shows all e-mails from contacts with whom
you already have a chat, but new chats only pop up for Delta Chat messages.
This helps to decide on a case-by-case basis whether you want to have a
conversation in Delta Chat or in a “normal” e-mail app.</li>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>If a message comes from an unknown contact, it appears as a <strong>request</strong>. You
need to accept the request before you can reply.</li>
  <li>You can also “delete” it if you don’t want to chat with them for now. This
does <em>not</em> delete the message on the server, only on your device. So you can
still deal with the message in a different mail app.</li>
  <li>If you delete a request, future messages from that contact will still appear
as message request, so you can change your mind. If you really don’t want to
receive messages from this person, consider <em>blocking</em> them.</li>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Yes. Beside the plain text, all e-mail attachments are displayed as separate messages. Outgoing messages get attachments as needed automatically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For performance, images are optimized and sent at a smaller size by default, but you can send it as a “file” to preserve the original.</p>

<p>You can easily work with additional accounts on Delta Chat mobile and desktop clients by clicking either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You can add a profile picture in your settings. If you write to your contacts
or add them via QR code, they automatically see it as your profile picture.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Contacts who don’t use Delta Chat do not see the profile picture
(however, of course, they can install Delta Chat :)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For privacy reasons, no one sees your profile picture until you write a
message to them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your profile picture isn’t sent with every message, but regularly enough that
your contacts will re-receive your profile picture, even if they add a new
device.</p>

      </h3>

<p>As with other E-Mail programs like Thunderbird, K9-Mail, or Outlook, the
program needs the password so you can use it to send mails. Of course, the
password is stored only on your device. The password is only transmitted to
your E-Mail provider (when you login), which has access to your mails anyway.</p>

<p>If you use an E-Mail provider with OAuth2 support like gmail.com or yandex.ru,
there is no need to store your password on the device. In this case, only an
access token is used.</p>

<p>As Delta Chat is Open Source, you can check the <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/blob/master/src/login_param.rs">Source
Code</a>
if you want to verify that your credentials are handled securely. We are happy
about feedback which makes the app more secure for all of our users.</p>

you may be asked to grant permissions to the app.
This is what Delta Chat does with these permissions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Camera <em>(can be disallowed)</em>
    <ul>
      <li>take pictures and videos: for sending Photos</li>
    </ul>

      </h3>

<p>Use these tools to organize your chats and keep everything in its place:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pinned chats</strong> always stay atop of the chat list. You can use them to access your most loved chats quickly or temporarily to not forget about things.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Mute chats</strong> if you do not want to get notifications for them. Muted chats stay in place and you can also pin a muted chat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Archive chats</strong> if you do not want to see them in your chat list any longer.
Archived chats remain accessible above the chat list or via search.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When an archived chat gets a new message, unless muted, it will <strong>pop out of the archive</strong> and back into your chat list.
<strong>Muted chats stay archived</strong> until you unarchive them manually.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To archive or pin a chat, long tap (Android), use the chat’s menu (Android/Desktop) or swipe to the left (iOS);
to mute a chat, use the chat’s menu (Android/Desktop) or the chat’s profile (iOS).</p>

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Since Delta Chat 1.34 you can sometimes see a “green dot” next to the avatar
of a contact. It means they were “recently seen”.</li>
  <li>In detail: it means, that in the last 10 minutes, Delta Chat has seen them:
    <ul>
      <li>either because they messaged you directly,</li>
      <li>because they wrote something to a group you are both a member of,</li>
      <li>because they sent you a read receipt for a message you wrote,</li>
      <li>or because they sent data to your Delta Chat app by using a
<a href="#webxdc">webxdc app</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>So this is not a real time online status - and if someone doesn’t answer
right away even though they seem to be online, don’t worry and give them some
space ;-)</li>
  <li>On the other hand, others will not always “see that you are online”. If you
have turned off read receipts, they will not see the green dot until you
message them or write to a group they’re in as well.</li>

<p>As you use an e-mail account for Delta Chat,
how you can delete your account depends on your e-mail provider.
We don’t have any control over your e-mail account,
so unfortunately we can’t help you with that.</p>

<p>If you want to keep the account,
but uninstall Delta Chat,
it is recommended to leave any group chat before uninstalling Delta Chat.</p>

<p>Meet your chat partner outside Delta Chat, preferably in person
but a second channel like a video chat
or a different messenger is fine as well.
Perform the following QR show/scan procedure with your chat partner.
One of you is the “Inviter”, the other is the “Joiner”.</p>

<p><strong>Inviter side</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Group invitation: 
Tap the chat group title to see its member list, and select “QR Invite code”. 
Share the QR image with the other side either in person or through a second channel.</p>

  <li>
    <p>Direct 1:1 chat invitation: 
Tap the QR Code icon <img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.8em; margin:1px" src="../qr-icon.png" />

  <li>
    <p>Tap “OK”</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Both Inviter and Joiner</strong>:</p>

<p>Wait while <a href="https://countermitm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/new.html#setup-contact-protocol">Secure-Join network messages are exchanged</a> between both devices.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If both devices are online,

<p>Chat titles with green checkmarks
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.5em; margin:1px" src="../green-checkmark.png" alt="green checkmark" />
mean that all messages in the chat will be end-to-end encrypted
and can not be read or altered by compromised e-mail servers or Internet providers. 
Joining green-checkmarked group chats
safely spreads everybody’s encryption information (and green checkmarks)
in a manner that guarantees end-to-end encryption in the group and among members.</p>

<p>Contact profiles with green checkmarks 
<img style="vertical-align:middle; width:1.5em; margin:1px" src="../green-checkmark.png" alt="green checkmark" />
mean that messaging a contact is currently guaranteed to be end-to-end encrypted.
Every green-checkmarked contact either did a direct <a href="#howtoe2ee">QR-scan</a> with you
or was introduced by a another green-checkmarked contact.
Introductions happen automatically when adding members to groups. 
Whoever adds a contact to a green-checkmarked group becomes an introducer 
to those members who didn’t yet know about the added contact.
In a contact profile you can tap on the “Introduced by …” text repeatedly
until you get to the one with whom you directly did a <a href="#howtoe2ee">QR-scan</a>.</p>

<p>Note that in a contact profile you may see and tap introducers 
but there is no green checkmark in the profile title. 
This usually means that the contact <a href="#nocryptanymore">“sent a message from another device”</a>.</p>

<p>Your chat with a contact lost guaranteed end-to-end encryption. 
The green checkmark was removed for this chat and contact when you see this warning. 
<strong>If you find the sudden drop of guaranteed end-to-end encryption 
surprising for this contact then don’t accept the warning!</strong>
Instead check with your contact through a second channel 
like a video call, other messenger or a phone call,
to find out what happened.</p>

<p>If your contact actually caused the drop of guaranteed end-to-end encryption
please see the next paragraphs for common reasons and their mitigations. 
Regardless, all other green-checkmarked chats remain guaranteed end-to-end encrypted
even if the contact is a member there.</p>

<p><strong>Your contact is using Delta Chat on a second device (phone or laptop)</strong></p>

<p>If they have another device with a Delta Chat app running,
they should remove the account from the new device
and add it <a href="#multiclient">as a second device as described here</a>.
As soon as they message you afterwards, the warning will be gone
and guaranteed encryption is established with both devices of your contact.</p>

<p><strong>Your contact reinstalled Delta Chat using their old account login</strong></p>

<p>If they have <a href="#backup">a backup file</a>, 
they should remove the account from the new device 
and rather import the backup file to re-create their account. 
As soon as they message you afterwards, the warning will be gone
and guaranteed encryption is re-established for this contact.</p>

<p>If they don’t have a backup file, it’s best to perform a <a href="#howtoe2ee">QR scan</a> 
with your chat partner to re-establish guaranteed end-to-end encryption.</p>

<p><strong>Your contact sent a mail through a webmail interface or another e-mail app
and will get back to using Delta Chat soon again.</strong></p>

<p>If you are sure that the contact sometimes uses webmail,
or another mail app lacking end-to-end encryption,
then you may accept the warning.
As soon as your contact uses Delta Chat again, 
guaranteed end-to-end encryption will be automatically re-established.</p>

<p><strong>Your contact stopped using Delta Chat entirely</strong></p>

<p>Sometimes remaining in contact is more important than end-to-end encryption.
<a href="#tls">“Transport Layer Encryption” (TLS)</a> may still meaningfully protect
the confidentiality of your messages between your device and the e-mail server. 
But without end-to-end encryption you and your contract are trusting your e-mail server 
to not read or manipulate your messages, and to not hand them to third parties.</p>

<p>In any case, you can not do much else than accept the warning.
Please also remove the contact from any active green-checkmarked group 
which you can find in “Shared chats” in the Contact profile. 
This spares your contact from getting “unreadable” messages.</p>

<p>If the contact removed Delta Chat because of buggy or undesirable behaviour, 
please consider posting to our <a href="https://support.delta.chat">support forum</a> 
to help us identify and address common problems. Thanks!</p>

we always mean a whole message is encrypted,
including all the attachments
and attachment metadata such as filenames.</p>

          Is OpenPGP secure? <a href="#openpgp-secure" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Yes, Delta Chat uses a secure subset of OpenPGP
and only displays a padlock security indicator on a message
if the whole message is properly encrypted and signed.
For example, “Detached signatures” are not treated as secure.</p>

<p>OpenPGP is not insecure by itself.
Most publically discussed OpenPGP security problems
actually stem from bad usability or bad implementations of tools or apps (or both).
It is particularly important to distinguish between OpenPGP, the IETF encryption standard, 
and GnuPG (GPG), a command line tool implementing OpenPGP. 
Many public critiques of OpenPGP actually discuss GnuPG which Delta Chat has never used. 
Delta Chat rather uses the OpenPGP Rust implementation <a href="https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp">rPGP</a>,
available as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pgp">an independent “pgp” package</a>,
and <a href="https://delta.chat/assets/blog/2019-first-security-review.pdf">security-audited in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>We aim, along with other OpenPGP implementors, 
to further improve security characteristics by implementing the
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh/">new IETF OpenPGP Crypto-Refresh</a> 
which was thankfully adopted in summer 2023.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Yes, we are following efforts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_Layer_Security">MLS</a>
or <a href="https://saltpack.org/">Saltpack</a> 
but adopting them would mean breaking end-to-end encryption interoperability 
with all other e-mail apps that typically support OpenPGP encryption. 
So it would not be a light decision to take 
and there must be tangible improvements for users.</p>

<p>Delta Chat takes a holistic “usable security” approach 
and works with a wide range of activist groupings as well as 
renowned researchers such as <a href="https://teamusec.de">TeamUSEC</a> 
to improve actual user outcomes against security threats. 
The wire protocol and standard for establishing end-to-end encryption is
only one part of “user outcomes”,

      </h3>

<p>No, <a href="https://delta.chat/en/2018-05-15-delta-chat-not-vulnerable-to-efail">Delta Chat never was vulnerable to EFAIL</a>
because its OpenPGP implementation <a href="https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp">rPGP</a> 
uses Modification Detection Code when encrypting messages
and returns <a href="https://docs.rs/pgp/latest/pgp/errors/enum.Error.html#variant.MdcError">an error</a>
if the Modification Detection Code is incorrect.</p>

<p>Delta Chat also never was vulnerable to the “Direct Exfiltration” EFAIL attack
because it only decrypts <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multipart/encrypted</code> messages
which contain exactly one encrypted and signed part,
as defined by the Autocrypt Level 1 specification.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Even if your messages are not guaranteed to be end-to-end encrypted, 
they are still protected from Internet providers like cell or cable companies. 
However, your and your recipient’s e-mail providers 
may read, analyze or even modify your messages, 
including any attachments,
if they are not end-to-end encrypted.</p>

<p>Delta Chat by default uses strict 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS encryption</a> 
which secures connections between your device and your e-mail provider. 
All of Delta Chat’s TLS-handling has been independently <a href="#security-audits">security audited</a>.
Moreover, the connection between your and the recipient’s e-mail provider
will typically be transport-encrypted as well.
If the involved e-mail servers support <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461">MTA-STS</a>
then transport encryption will be enforced between e-mail providers 
in which case Delta Chat communications will never be exposed in cleartext to the Internet
even if the message was not end-to-end encrypted.</p>

<p>Note that <a href="#howtoe2ee">maintaining guaranteed end-to-end encryption</a> on top of TLS encryption 
provides pervasive safety between your and the recipient’s devices.
Not even your e-mail or Internet provider will be able to read or modify your messages.</p>
    
      <h3 id="message-metadata">
        
        
          How does Delta Chat protect metadata in messages? <a href="#message-metadata" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Delta Chat protects most message metadata by putting the following information
into the end-to-end encrypted part of messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Subject line</li>
  <li>Group avatar and name</li>
  <li>MDN (read receipt) requests (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Chat-Disposition-Notification-To</code>)</li>
  <li>Disappearing message timer (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ephemeral-Timer</code>)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Chat-Group-Member-Removed</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Chat-Group-Member-Added</code></li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure-Join</code> header containing secure join commands</li>
  <li>Notification about enabling location streaming</li>
  <li>WebRTC room URL</li>
</ul>

<p>E-Mail servers do not get access to this protected metadata 
but they do see the message date as well as the message size,
and, more importantly, the sender and receiver addresses. 
E-mail servers need receiver addresses to route and 
deliver messages to recipient’s devices.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Both for protecting against metadata-collecting e-mail servers 
as well as against the threat of device seizure
we recommend to use a Delta Chat optimized <a href="https://delta.chat/serverguide">e-mail server instance</a>
to create pseudonymous temporary accounts through QR-code scans.
Note that Delta Chat apps on all platforms support multiple accounts 
so you can easily use action-specific “1-week” or “1-month” accounts next to your “main” account
with the knowledge that all temporary account data, along with all metadata, will be deleted.
Moreover, if a device is seized then contacts using temporary e-mail accounts
can not be identified easily, as compared to messengers which reveal
phone numbers in chat groups which in turn are often associated with legal identities.</p>

      </h3>

<p>You may check the end-to-end encryption status manually in the “Encryption” dialog
(user profile on Android/iOS or right-click a user’s chat-list item on desktop).
Delta Chat shows two fingerprints there.
If the same fingerprints appear on your own and your contact’s device,
the connection is safe.</p>

      </h3>

<p>A little <strong>padlock</strong> in a message bubble denotes
that the message was properly end-to-end encrypted from the given sender.
If there is <strong>no padlock</strong>, the message was not properly end-to-end encrypted
most likely because the sender uses an app or webmail interface
without support for end-to-end–encryption.</p>

<p>If a contact uses a non-Autocrypt e-mail app,
all messages involving this contact (in a group or 1:1 chat)
will not be end-to-end encrypted, and thus not show a “padlock” with messages.
Note that even if your contacts use Delta Chat on their account,
they might also use a non-Autocrypt e-mail app on that account
which then may cause intermittently unencrypted messages.
Replying unencrypted to unencrypted messages is mandated by Autocrypt
to prevent unreadable messages on the side of your contacts
and their non-Autocrypt e-mail app.</p>

<p>The best way to ensure every message is end-to-end encrypted,
and metadata deleted as quickly as possible
is <a href="#howtoe2ee">using chats with guaranteed end-to-end encryption</a>
and turning on disappearing messages.</p>

<p>Guranteed end-to-end encrypted chats protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM attacks</a>
and turning on “disappearing messages” deletes the messages
on the server after a user-configured time.</p>

<p>If you don’t need a longer-lived copy of your messages on the server, 
you can also turn on <a href="#delold">“delete messages from server automatically”</a>.</p>

          Does Delta Chat support Perfect Forward Secrecy? <a href="#pfs" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>No, Delta Chat doesn’t support Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
This means that if your Delta Chat private decryption key is leaked,
and someone has collected your prior in-transit messages,
they will be able to decrypt and read them using the leaked decryption key.</p>

<p>Note, however, that if anyone obtains to your decryption keys, 
they will typically also be able to obtain your messages, 
irrespective if Perfect Forward Secrecy is in place or not. 
The typical real-world situation for leaked decryption keys is device seizure
which we discuss in our answer <a href="#device-seizure">on metadata and device seizure</a>.</p>

<p>It is possible that Delta Chat evolves to support Perfect Forward Secrecy,
because OpenPGP is just a container for encrypted messages 
but encryption key management (and thus key rotation or key “ratcheting”) 
could be organized in flexible ways. 
See <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/openpgp-dr">Seqouia’s PFS prototype</a>
for existing experiments in the OpenPGP implementor community.</p>

      </h3>

<p>It depends on what is important to you. 
Delta Chat <a href="#pfs">does not support PFS</a> like Signal does
but it provides <a href="#e2eeguarantee">guaranteed end-to-end encrypted chats</a>
that are safe against compromised servers or corrupted networks. 
Signal and most other PFS-supporting messengers do not provide 
a practical scheme for protecting chat groups from network attacks
which are arguably more worrysome 
than a potential attacker who seizes your phone and private encryption setup
but somehow not your messages, yet has a full record of all 
past encrypted messages.</p>

<p>In any case, Delta Chat’s end-to-end encryption uses a <a href="#openpgp-secure">secure subset of OpenPGP</a>
which has been <a href="https://delta.chat/assets/blog/2019-first-security-review.pdf">independently security-audited</a>.</p>

      </h3>

<p>Yes.
The best way is to send an Autocrypt Setup Message from the other e-mail client.
Look for something like <strong>Start Autocrypt Setup Transfer</strong> in the settings of the other client and follow the instructions shown there.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can import the key manually in “Settings -&gt; Advanced settings -&gt; Import secret keys”.
Caution: Make sure the key is not protected by a password, or remove the password beforehand.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a key or don’t even know you would need one - don’t worry: Delta Chat generates keys as needed, you don’t have to hit a button for it.</p>

      </h3>

<p>The most likely cause is that your key is encrypted and/or uses
a password. Such keys are not supported by Delta Chat.  You could remove the
passphrase encryption and the password and try the import again.  If you want
to keep your passphrase you’ll have to create an e-mail alias for use
with Delta Chat such that Delta Chat’s key is tied to this e-mail alias.</p>

<p>Delta Chat supports common OpenPGP private key formats, however, it
is unlikely that private keys from all sources will be fully supported. This
is not the main goal of Delta Chat. In fact, the majority of new users 
will not have any key prior to using Delta Chat.
We do, however, try to support private keys from as many sources as possible.</p>

<p>Removing the password from the private key will depend on the
software you use to manage your PGP keys. With Enigmail, you can set your
password to an empty value in the Key Management window. With GnuPG you can set
it <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-android/issues/98#issuecomment-378383429">via the command
line</a>.
For other programs, you should be able to find a solution online.</p>

<p>Yes. Delta Chat 1.36 comes with a new, experimental function for using the same account on different devices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure both devices are on the same Wi-Fi or network</p>

  <li>
    <p>On the first device, go to <strong>Settings → Add Second Device</strong>, unlock the screen if needed

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the second device, start Delta Chat, select <strong>Add as Second Device</strong>, and scan the QR code from the old device</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transfer should start after a few seconds and during transfer both devices will show the <strong>progress</strong>.
Wait until it is finished on both devices.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In contrast to many other messengers, after successful transfer,
both <strong>devices are completely independent.</strong>
One device is not needed for the other to work.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your system might have a “personal firewall”,

<strong>Disable the personal firewall</strong> for Delta Chat on both ends and try again</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ensure there is <strong>enough storage</strong> on the destination device</p>

  <li>
    <p>If transfer started, make sure, the devices <strong>stay active</strong> and do not fall asleep.
Do not exit Delta Chat.

<p>This method is only recommended if “Add Second Device” as described above does not work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>On the old device, go to “Settings -&gt; Chats and media -&gt; Export Backup”. Enter your
screen unlock PIN, pattern, or password. Then you can click on “Start
Backup”. This saves the backup file to your device. Now you have to transfer
it to the other device somehow.</li>
  <li>On the new device, on the login screen, instead of logging into your email
account, choose “Import Backup”. After import, your conversations, encryption
keys, and media should be copied to the new device.

<p>Sending a copy of your messages to yourself ensures that you receive your own
messages on all devices. If you have multiple devices and don’t turn it on, you
see only the messages from other people, and the messages you send from the
current device.</p>

<p>The copy is sent to the Inbox, and then moved to the DeltaChat folder; it’s not
put into the “Sent” folder. Delta Chat <em>never</em> uploads anything to the Sent
folder because this would mean uploading a message twice (once through SMTP,
and once through IMAP to Sent folder).</p>

<p>The default setting for copy-to-self is “no”.</p>

<p>The only reason one wants to watch the Sent folder is if you are using another

to participate in chat conversations.</p>

<p>However, we recommend using the Delta Chat Desktop Client; you can download it
on <a href="https://get.delta.chat">get.delta.chat</a>. The option to watch the “Sent”
folder might go away in the future. It was introduced at a time where there was
no Delta Chat Desktop client available on all platforms.</p>

  <li>This feature will not share your location with anyone except your chat

specific area. If this is a privacy risk for you, this feature might not be
for you. We are working on finding a decentralized alternative for Mapbox.</li>

However, some providers need special options to work properly,

<ul>
  <li>Most mail servers will work well. But what we personally recommend is a
combination of mailcow and mailadm, as described <a href="https://delta.chat/en/2023-01-27-upcoming-mail-server-workshops">in this
blogpost</a>.</li>

          If Delta Chat uses E-Mail, is it really an <em>Instant</em> Messenger? <a href="#if-delta-chat-uses-e-mail-is-it-really-an-instant-messenger" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Sending and receiving messages takes a few seconds, typically. Sometimes
there are cases where it takes longer but that is arguably true as well for
any other messenger.</li>
  <li>Instant chatting works fast if both parties are actively using the app. It’s
sometimes slower if the app is running in the background.</li>
  <li>Receiving messages then can take minutes because both Android and iOS often
stop Delta Chat from running in the background, and only wake it up
occasionally. This artificial delay is usually worse on iOS than on Android.</li>
  <li>However, Android and iOS kill apps running in the background is a
problem for many legitimate apps. For more information, see

      </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Yes and No.</li>
  <li>No, you can not use your Protonmail, Tutanota, or Criptext account with Delta
Chat; they do not offer receiving mails via IMAP.</li>
  <li>In any case you can use Delta Chat to send Messages to people who use
Protonmail, Tutanota, or Criptext. Those messages will not be end-to-end
encrypted, though. The end-to-end encryption those providers offer is not
compatible with <a href="https://autocrypt.org/">Autocrypt</a>, the standard Delta Chat
uses.</li>
  <li>Delta Chat can end-to-end-encrypt through any e-mail provider with any
<a href="https://autocrypt.org/dev-status.html">Autocrypt-enabled e-mail app</a>.</li>

          Was Delta Chat independently audited for security vulnerabilities? <a href="#security-audits" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>The Delta Chat project underwent four independent security audits in the last years:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In 2019, <a href="https://includesecurity.com">Include Security</a> analyzed Delta
Chat’s <a href="https://github.com/rpgp/rpgp">PGP</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA">RSA</a> libraries.
It found no critical issues,
but two high-severity issues that we subsequently fixed.
It also revealed one medium-severity and some less severe issues,
but there was no way to exploit these vulnerabilities in the Delta Chat implementation.
Some of them we nevertheless fixed since the audit was concluded.
You can read the <a href="https://delta.chat/assets/blog/2019-first-security-review.pdf">full report here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2020, <a href="https://includesecurity.com">Include Security</a> analyzed Delta
Chat’s Rust <a href="https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core-rust/">core</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/async-email/async-imap">IMAP</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/async-email/async-smtp">SMTP</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/async-email/async-native-tls">TLS</a> libraries.
It did not find any critical or high-severity issues.
The report raised a few medium-severity weaknesses -
they are no threat to Delta Chat users on their own
because they depend on the environment in which Delta Chat is used.
For usability and compatibility reasons,
we can not mitigate all of them
and decided to provide security recommendations to threatened users.
You can read the <a href="https://delta.chat/assets/blog/2020-second-security-review.pdf">full report here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beginning 2023, <a href="https://cure53.de">Cure53</a> analyzed both the transport encryption of
Delta Chat’s network connections and a reproducible mail server setup as
<a href="https://delta.chat/en/serverguide">recommended on this site</a>.
You can read more about the audit <a href="https://delta.chat/en/2023-03-27-third-independent-security-audit">on our blog</a>
or read the <a href="https://delta.chat/assets/blog/MER-01-report.pdf">full report here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beginning 2023, we fixed security and privacy issues with the “web
apps shared in a chat” feature, related to failures of sandboxing
especially with Chromium. We subsequently got an independent security
audit from Cure53 and all issues found were fixed in the 1.36 app series released in April 2023.

          How are Delta Chat developments funded? <a href="#how-are-delta-chat-developments-funded" class="anchor"></a>
        
        
      </h3>

<p>Delta Chat does not receive any Venture Capital and
is not indebted, and under no pressure to produce huge profits, or to 
sell users and their friends and family to advertisers (or worse). 
We rather use public funding sources, so far from EU and US origins, to help
our efforts in instigating a decentralized and diverse chat messaging eco-system
based on Free and Open-Source community developments.</p>

<p>Concretely, Delta Chat developments have so far been funded from these sources:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://nextleap.eu">NEXTLEAP</a> EU project funded the research
and implementation of verified groups and setup contact protocols
in 2017 and 2018 and also helped to integrate end-to-end Encryption
through <a href="https://autocrypt.org">Autocrypt</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://opentechfund.org">Open Technology Fund</a> gave us a 
first 2018/2019 grant (~$200K) during which we majorly improved the Android app 
and released a first Desktop app beta version, and which moreover 
moored our feature developments in UX research in human rights contexts, 
see our concluding <a href="https://delta.chat/en/2019-07-19-uxreport">Needfinding and UX report</a>.
The second 2019/2020 grant (~$300K) helped us to 
release Delta/iOS versions, to convert our core library to Rust, and
to provide new features for all platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://nlnet.nl/">NLnet foundation</a> granted in 2019/2020 EUR 46K for
completing Rust/Python bindings and instigating a Chat-bot eco-system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In 2021 we received further EU funding for two Next-Generation-Internet
proposals, namely for <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/eppd/">EPPD - e-mail provider portability directory</a> (~97K EUR) and <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/EmailPorting/">AEAP - email address porting</a> (~90K EUR) which resulted in better multi-account support, improved QR-code contact and group setups and many networking improvements on all platforms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From End 2021 till March 2023 we received <em>Internet Freedom</em> funding (500K USD) from the
U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor (DRL). 
This funding supported our long-running goals to make Delta Chat more usable 
and compatible with a wide range of e-mail servers world-wide, and more resilient and secure
in places often affected by internet censorship and shutdowns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Beginning 2023 we got accepted in the Next Generation Internet (NGI)
Entrust program for our “Private Decentralized Apps” proposals. 
Exact amount is to be determined (around 100K EUR). 
This funding supports further developments of <a href="https://webxdc.org">webxdc “apps shared in a chat”</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes we receive one-time donations from private individuals. 
For example, in 2021 a generous individual bank-wired us 4K EUR 
with the subject “keep up the good developments!”. 💜 
We use such money to fund development gatherings or to care for ad-hoc expenses 
that can not easily be predicted for, or reimbursed from, public funding grants. 
Receiving more donations also helps us to become more independent and long-term viable
as a contributor community.</p>

    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but by far not least, several pro-bono experts and enthusiasts contributed 
and contribute to Delta Chat developments without receiving money, or only 
small amounts. Without them, Delta Chat would not be where it is today, not
even close.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The monetary funding mentioned above is mostly organized by merlinux GmbH in
Freiburg (Germany), and is distributed to more than a dozen contributors world-wide.</p>

<p>Please see <a href="https://delta.chat/en/contribute">Delta Chat Contribution channels</a>
for both monetary and and other contribution possibilities.</p>
